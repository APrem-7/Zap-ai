## How to Delete the Branches

### Method 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. Go to https://github.com/APrem-7/Meet-ai/branches
2. You'll see a "Merged branches" section
3. Click the delete icon (🗑️) next to each branch listed above
4. Confirm the deletion

### Method 2: Using the Provided Script

If you have push permissions to the repository:

```bash
# Navigate to the repository
cd Meet-ai

# Run the script
./delete-merged-branches.sh
```

The script will:
- Show you the list of branches to delete
- Ask for confirmation
- Delete each branch one by one
- Provide a summary of successes and failures
- Show the remaining branches

### Method 3: Manual Command Line

If you prefer to delete branches manually:

```bash
git push origin --delete BetterAuth
git push origin --delete AuthUI-SignUp
git push origin --delete AuthUI-Socials-Callbacks
git push origin --delete AuthUI-Socials
git push origin --delete AuthUI
git push origin --delete Dashboard-Navbar
git push origin --delete Dashboard
git push origin --delete Backend
git push origin --delete Agents
git push origin --delete new-Backend
git push origin --delete windsurf-changes
git push origin --delete windsurf-changes-v2
```

## Important Notes

### ✅ Safe to Delete
All the branches listed above have been:
- Successfully merged into `main`
- Their code is preserved in the main branch
- Associated pull requests are closed
- No longer actively developed

### ❌ Branches Kept
The following branches are NOT being deleted:
- `main` - Protected default branch
- `copilot/remove-unnecessary-branches` - Current working branch
- `copilot/fix-agents-loading-page` - Recent work, potentially useful
- `copilot/vscode-mjaf79kh-mb5z` - Draft PR, not merged
- `sidechanges` - No PR history, needs investigation

## Verification

After deletion, verify the cleanup:

```bash
# List all remote branches
git ls-remote --heads origin

# Or visit GitHub
https://github.com/APrem-7/Meet-ai/branches
```

## Why Clean Up Branches?

1. **Improved Repository Navigation** - Easier to find active branches
2. **Reduced Clutter** - Cleaner branch list
3. **Better Maintenance** - Easier to understand repository structure
